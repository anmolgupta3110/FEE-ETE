<p>
  <b>1.  Introduction <br></b>
Acceptance. By using the Website or Services in any manner, you are bound by these Terms of Service, as well as the Incorporated Terms identified below (collectively, the “Terms”). If you do not agree to the Terms, then do not use the Website or Services. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that (a) you are authorized to do so, (b) the entity agrees to be legally bound by the Terms, and (c) neither you nor the entity are barred from using the Services or accepting the Terms under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.</p>
<p> Scope. These Terms govern your use of the Website and the Services. Except as otherwise specified, these Terms do not apply to Third-Party Products, which are governed by their own terms of service.</p>
<p>Incorporated Terms. The following policies, guidelines, and agreements (“Incorporated Terms”) are hereby incorporated into, and form an integral part of, the Terms to which you are agreeing to be bound</p>
<p>Contracting Entity. “BigCommerce” means the BigCommerce entity with which you are entering into these Terms. If you have previously entered into an agreement with a BigCommerce entity, then “BigCommerce” means that entity. If you have not previously entered into an agreement with a BigCommerce entity, then “BigCommerce” means the entity identified in the following table</p>
<b><p>2. Eligibility. <br></b>
    Minimum Age. The Services and Website are available only to persons who are the age of majority and can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Services and Website are not intended to be used by individuals under the age of 18. If you do not qualify, please do not use the Services or access the Website.
    </p>
    <p>Registration. In order to use the Services, you must establish a Services account (“Account”) by registering with BigCommerce. You may be required to submit a valid means of payment for which you are authorized to purchase Services. You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete information when registering for an Account and will update the information as necessary to keep your Account and payment information current. As part of the registration process, you will provide BigCommerce with a user name and password for your Account (together “Account Credentials”). BigCommerce reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, accounts that violate these Terms or BigCommerce’s Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
<b><p>3. Security. <br></b>
        Generally. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account Credentials and for all Services ordered, accessed, or otherwise used in connection with your Account Credentials and all actions taken in association therewith. You will not share your Account Credentials with any third party.</p>
        <p>Payment Cards. BigCommerce is responsible for the security of credit cardholder data to the extent that BigCommerce has control of that data. To that end, BigCommerce undertakes regular assessments consistent with the applicable Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI”). You represent and warrant that you will determine the PCI merchant requirements applicable to you and your use of the Services.</p>
        <p>Checkout Environment; PCI. BigCommerce will provide a secure environment (including appropriate technical, physical and organizational security measures and safeguards) for customer data stored and processed via the standard BigCommerce checkout (“Customer Data”) in order to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access and use. BigCommerce’s secure environment is certified under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. BigCommerce will maintain PCI certification for the designated portions of the Services that you use to store and process credit card data, subject to the following (each a “PCI Compliance Condition”): (i) you comply with BigCommerce documentation and in-product notifications, and (ii) you use a BigCommerce checkout environment that has not been modified except through the BigCommerce control panel. To the extent permitted by applicable law, BigCommerce excludes and disclaims any liability related to the unauthorized use of Customer Data, including liability due to PCI noncompliance, in the event any PCI Compliance Condition is not satisfied. For example, you will be solely liable for PCI compliance with respect to modifications to the checkout environment, including modifications via apps or a developer, modifications of BigCommerce's distributed open source checkout code in any manner that could result in or contribute to PCI noncompliance, use of a checkout environment not provided by BigCommerce, or use of a payment provider for which BigCommerce does not provide an integration.</p>
        <p> <b>4. Use Restrictions. <br></b>
            This is an agreement for Services, and you are not granted a license to any software by these Terms. Except as permitted and non-excludable under applicable law, you will not, directly or indirectly: reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of or included in the Services or any software, documentation or data related to the Services (“Software”); modify, translate or create derivative works based on the Services or any Software; or copy (except for archival purposes), distribute, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the Services or any Software; use the Services or any Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the benefit of a third party; or remove any proprietary notices or labels.
            </p>

<p><b>5. Intellectual Property.</b></p>
            <p>Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that, for all such content you provide, you own or otherwise control all necessary rights to do so and to meet your obligations under these Terms. You represent and warrant that such content is accurate. You represent and warrant that use of any such content (including derivative works) by us, our users, or others in contract with us, and in compliance with these Terms, does not and will not infringe any IP Rights of any third party. To the extent permitted by applicable law, BigCommerce takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content provided by you or any third party.</p>
            <p>Restrictions. All rights not expressly granted by BigCommerce to you in these Terms are hereby reserved by BigCommerce. There are no implied rights save to the extent rights cannot be excluded by applicable law. You may not use, imitate, or copy, in whole or in part, any BigCommerce trademark, service mark, trade dress, logo, or other branding (collectively, “Marks”) without, in each instance, BigCommerce’s prior written consent, in BigCommerce’s discretion. All permitted use of BigCommerce’s Marks will inure to the benefit of BigCommerce.</p>
            <p>Ownership. As between the parties, the Website and Services, including, without limitation, any and all APIs, Software, documentation, images, video, content, logos, page headers, custom graphics, design and user interface elements, scripts, and other materials contained therein or provided in connection therewith, and all modifications, enhancements, and updates thereto, as well as all IP Rights associated with any of these materials (collectively, "BigCommerce IP") are owned by BigCommerce and/or its third party sponsors, partners, and suppliers. You have no right or license in or to the BigCommerce IP other than the right to use the Services, in compliance with the Terms, during the applicable subscription period.</p>
<p><b>6. Indemnification.</b>
    Indemnification. You will defend, indemnify, and hold BigCommerce and its suppliers and affiliates, and the respective directors, officers, employees and agents of each, harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to your breach of any of these Terms, the User Content, or use by you or any third party (authorized, permitted or enabled by you) of the Services, except to the extent the foregoing directly result from BigCommerce’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. BigCommerce reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. This Indemnification Section will survive any termination or expiration or these Terms.
    </p>
    <p><b>7. Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver and Mediation.</b>
        Purpose. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver (“Arbitration Agreement”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and BigCommerce. For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, “BigCommerce” means BigCommerce, Inc., a Texas corporation, and each of its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. This Arbitration Agreement applies to these Terms and any other agreement you may have with BigCommerce.
        Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial. You have the right to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.
        </p>
        <p>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all disputes between you and BigCommerce will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages</p>
